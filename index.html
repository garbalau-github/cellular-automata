                        The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It
                        is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge
                        mathematician John Conway.

                        This game became widely known when it was mentioned in
                        an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It
                        consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few
                        mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending
                        on the initial conditions, the cells form various
                        patterns throughout the course of the game.
